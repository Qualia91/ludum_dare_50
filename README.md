# Welcome to my Ludum Dare 50 Compo Submission!!!

## About
The theme this year was Delay the inevitable

So, my game starts off as a simple 3D platformer. Your little cheerio jump using arrows or WASD about the platform dodging all the red things.

But, when you get to the end, you get transported back to the beginning, but this time you are stuck the rails you just created! All you can do is hold space to stop (thus delaying the inevitable!) in an error to dodge the enemies.

## Licence
Everything is 100% made by me, as per the requirements of the compo entry. Feel free to steal anything, but be sure to check out my itch page and drop me a message about how you found the game, or even check out my other games!
